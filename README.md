[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/upworthy/heroku-buildpack-boot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/upworthy/heroku-buildpack-boot)

## Configuration

By default, there's an expectation that the app's `build.boot`
file defines `build` task that takes care of all sorts of build-time
concerns (e.g. pulling dependencies from repos eagerly). If a more
complicated logic is desired at build-time, it can be overriden by
specifying `BOOTBUILD_CMD` var that contains, say, a more complex boot
pipeline. For instance:

    BOOTBUILD_CMD="boot foo -x -- bar --blah -q -- qaz"

`boot` executable version is pinned and will be updated from to time
to the most recent one. It can be controlled by setting `BOOT_SH_VERSION`
to `latest` or to a desired version. For example:

    BOOT_SH_VERSION=2.4.2

`boot-clj` framework version used by this buildpack is pinned and
will be updated from to time to the most recent one. It can be set
to a desired version by setting `BOOT_VERSION`. For example:

    BOOT_VERSION=2.5.5

To expose more config vars at build-time, set a
`BOOTBUILD_CONFIG_WHITELIST` config var containing a space-delimited
list of config var names. Note that this can result in unpredictable
behaviour since changing your app's config does not result in a
rebuild of your app. So it's easy to get into a situation where your
build is broken, but you don't notice it until later when you
push. For this reason it's recommended to take care with this feature
and always push after changing a whitelisted config value.

## JDK Version

By default you will get OpenJDK 1.8. To use a different version, you
can commit a `system.properties` file to your app.

```sh-session
$ echo "java.runtime.version=1.7" > system.properties
$ git add system.properties
$ git commit -m "JDK 7"
```

## Testing

You can either test this buildpack locally with Docker, or run the tests on
Heroku. To use Heroku, create a new app with the testrunner buildpack, push the
buildpack code, and then run the tests:

```
$ heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku run tests
...
------
ALL OK
239 SECONDS
```

To test with Docker, first build the [testrunner image](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner)
and then run the `test.sh` script.

**NOTE**: The `tests-with-caching` target fails when downloading the boot.sh binary.

## Troubleshooting

You may get into a situation where some wrong version of the `boot` executable or
the framework is cached in the app's build cache. You can purge this cache like so:

    $ heroku plugins:install heroku-repo # <- one time installation step
    $ heroku repo:purge_cache -a appname

After a purge, you will need to push another build of your app to have it fully
rebuilt with the build cache in clean state. Alternatively, you can reset Heroku's
app source code repository by doing `heroku repo:reset -a appname`.

## Credits

Thanks to the authors of various official Heroku buildpacks for
providing excellent documentation and clearly written source code. In
particular, config var whitelisting has been inspired by
[Clojure buildpack.][1]
